## Lab Setup
Power
- 12V
- 2A
- OCP

## Field Experiment
Radar was attached behind tractor at 35 degrees to calculate relationship between frequency and speed.  3 runs were conducted at 5, 10, and 15 mph.

### Average frequency
- 5 mph = 155.273833333
- 10 mph = 309.395368852
- 15 mph = 463.337017544
